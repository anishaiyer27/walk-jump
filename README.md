# Reimplementation of discrete Walk-Jump Sampling (dWJS)

This project is based on [discrete Walk-Jump Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12360) which was developed by [ncfrey](https://github.com/ncfrey), [djberenberg](https://github.com/djberenberg), [kleinhenz](https://github.com/kleinhenz), and [saeedsaremi](https://github.com/saeedsaremi), from [Prescient Design, a Genentech accelerator.](https://gene.com/prescient)

The following restates the setup, training, sampling and evaluation instructions from the original repository.

## Setup
Assuming you have [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed, clone the repository, navigate inside, and run:
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

## Training
The entrypoint `walkjump_train` is the main driver for training and accepts parameters using Hydra syntax.
The available parameters for configuration can be found by running `train` --help or by looking in the `src/walkjump/hydra_config` directory

## Sampling
The entrypoint `walkjump_sample` is the main driver for training and accepts parameters using Hydra syntax.
The available parameters for configuration can be found by running `sample` --help or by looking in the `src/walkjump/hydra_config` directory

## Evaluation

### Large molecule descriptors
Use the [LargeMoleculeDescriptors](src/walkjump/metrics/_large_molecule_descriptors.py) class to compute descriptors for large molecules (proteins, antibodies, etc.) and see the [code for computing Wasserstein distances between samples and reference distributions](src/walkjump/metrics/_get_batch_descriptors.py) for evaluating sample quality.

### Distributional conformity score (DCS)
See the [DCS code](src/walkjump/conformity/_conformity_score.py) and [DCS README](src/walkjump/conformity/README.md) to evaluate samples.
